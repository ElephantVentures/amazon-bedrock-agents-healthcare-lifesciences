# Sapablursen (ISIS 702843/IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx): A Comprehensive Scientific Review

## Executive Summary

Sapablursen (formerly ISIS 702843 or IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx) is an innovative antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutic targeting TMPRSS6 (transmembrane protease serine 6, also known as matriptase-2), a key negative regulator of hepcidin production. By inhibiting TMPRSS6 expression, Sapablursen increases hepcidin levels, thereby reducing iron availability and effectively modulating erythropoiesis. This mechanism shows therapeutic potential for conditions characterized by iron dysregulation, including beta-thalassemia, polycythemia vera, and other iron overload disorders. The drug represents a significant advancement in the management of these conditions through its targeted approach to iron homeostasis modulation, leveraging Ionis Pharmaceuticals' LIgand-Conjugated Antisense (LICA) technology for enhanced liver-specific delivery and extended dosing intervals of approximately once every four weeks.

## Molecular Mechanism and Design

Sapablursen is a second-generation antisense oligonucleotide designed with LICA technology that specifically targets TMPRSS6 mRNA in hepatocytes. TMPRSS6 normally functions as a suppressor of hepcidin expression by cleaving hemojuvelin, a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) co-receptor that promotes hepcidin transcription. By reducing TMPRSS6 expression, Sapablursen indirectly upregulates hepcidin production, which in turn decreases iron absorption from the gut and iron release from macrophages by binding to and promoting the degradation of ferroportin, the sole cellular iron exporter.

The antisense design of Sapablursen incorporates advanced modifications that enhance its stability, reduce off-target effects, and improve pharmacokinetic properties. The LICA technology specifically incorporates a triantennary N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) moiety that binds with high affinity to the asialoglycoprotein receptor, which is abundantly expressed on hepatocytes, thus facilitating liver-targeted delivery and reducing required doses.

## Preclinical Studies

Preclinical investigations with Sapablursen or related TMPRSS6-targeting ASOs have demonstrated several important findings:

1. In mouse models of beta-thalassemia, TMPRSS6 inhibition led to increased hepcidin expression, decreased iron overload, improved anemia, and reduced ineffective erythropoiesis.

2. Studies in non-human primates showed that Sapablursen administration resulted in dose-dependent reductions in serum iron and transferrin saturation, along with increases in hepcidin levels, confirming the mechanism of action across species.

3. The LICA formulation demonstrated significantly improved potency compared to non-conjugated ASOs targeting TMPRSS6, allowing for lower and less frequent dosing regimens.

4. In polycythemia vera mouse models, TMPRSS6 inhibition effectively reduced red blood cell count, hemoglobin levels, and hematocrit through iron restriction, offering a novel approach to managing this condition without conventional phlebotomy.

## Clinical Trials

While detailed published clinical trial results are limited, Sapablursen has progressed through early-phase clinical development:

1. A Phase 1 study evaluated safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers, showing acceptable safety profiles and confirming target engagement through modulation of iron parameters.

2. Ionis Pharmaceuticals has indicated plans for investigating Sapablursen in beta-thalassemia and potentially other conditions like polycythemia vera, where restricting iron availability could provide therapeutic benefit by limiting excessive erythropoiesis.

The clinical development program appears to be leveraging the extended pharmacodynamic effects observed with the drug, potentially enabling monthly dosing schedules that would represent a significant advantage over more frequently administered therapies targeting the hepcidin pathway.

## Therapeutic Applications

The clinical potential of Sapablursen spans several therapeutic areas where iron homeostasis plays a central pathophysiological role:

### Beta-Thalassemia

In beta-thalassemia, ineffective erythropoiesis and anemia lead to suppression of hepcidin and consequent iron overload, which causes significant morbidity. By increasing hepcidin levels, Sapablursen could address both the ineffective erythropoiesis and the iron overload simultaneously, potentially reducing transfusion requirements in transfusion-dependent patients and improving hemoglobin levels in non-transfusion-dependent patients.

### Polycythemia Vera

In polycythemia vera, excessive red blood cell production can be mitigated by restricting iron availability. Sapablursen's mechanism of increasing hepcidin and thereby limiting iron for erythropoiesis represents a novel approach to controlling erythrocytosis without directly suppressing bone marrow function, potentially offering a better safety profile than cytoreductive therapies.

### Other Iron Overload Disorders

The mechanism of Sapablursen could be beneficial in hereditary hemochromatosis and other conditions where inappropriately low hepcidin levels drive excessive iron absorption and tissue iron deposition. By pharmacologically increasing hepcidin, Sapablursen could reduce the need for phlebotomy and chelation therapies.

## What Makes Sapablursen Efficient?

Sapablursen offers several potential advantages over existing therapies:

1. **Extended dosing interval**: The monthly administration represents a significant improvement over more frequently administered treatments like hepcidin mimetics that may require weekly dosing, enhancing patient compliance.

2. **Targeted approach**: The liver-specific delivery via GalNAc conjugation minimizes systemic exposure and potential off-target effects, allowing for lower doses and improved safety.

3. **Upstream regulation**: By targeting a key regulator of hepcidin rather than replacing hepcidin itself, Sapablursen may achieve more physiological modulation of iron homeostasis.

4. **Dual therapeutic effect**: In conditions like beta-thalassemia, the drug addresses both ineffective erythropoiesis and iron overload simultaneously.

5. **Reversible mechanism**: Unlike gene therapy or permanent genetic modifications, the antisense approach allows for dose adjustment or discontinuation if needed.

## Research Gaps and Future Directions

Several important questions remain regarding Sapablursen's clinical utility:

1. **Long-term safety**: The effects of chronic TMPRSS6 inhibition and sustained hepcidin elevation need further evaluation, particularly regarding potential impacts on erythropoiesis in normal conditions.

2. **Patient selection**: Determining which patient populations would benefit most from this therapeutic approach requires additional investigation.

3. **Combination therapies**: The potential for synergistic effects when combined with other treatments (e.g., luspatercept in beta-thalassemia) has not been extensively explored.

4. **Biomarkers**: Development of reliable biomarkers to predict and monitor response to therapy would enhance clinical application.

## Conclusions

Sapablursen represents a promising therapeutic approach for disorders of iron metabolism through its targeted inhibition of TMPRSS6 and consequent upregulation of hepcidin. The drug's antisense oligonucleotide design, enhanced by LICA technology for liver-specific delivery, offers advantages of specificity and extended dosing intervals compared to other approaches targeting the hepcidin pathway.

While clinical data remain limited in the public domain, the scientific rationale is robust, based on extensive understanding of iron homeostasis mechanisms and preclinical evidence supporting TMPRSS6 as a therapeutic target. The potential applications in beta-thalassemia, polycythemia vera, and other iron disorders address significant unmet medical needs where current treatments have limitations.

As Sapablursen progresses through clinical development, key focus areas should include defining optimal patient populations, establishing long-term safety, exploring combination approaches, and developing predictive biomarkers of response. The continued investigation of this innovative therapeutic could significantly advance the management of disorders where iron dysregulation plays a central pathophysiological role.
