# Sapablursen (ISIS 702843/IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx): A Systematic Review of Mechanism, Efficacy, and Clinical Development

## Abstract
This systematic review examines the available scientific literature on Sapablursen (formerly ISIS 702843/IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx), an antisense oligonucleotide targeting transmembrane protease serine 6 (TMPRSS6). A comprehensive search was conducted across biomedical databases, identifying preclinical studies and early clinical trials. Evidence indicates that Sapablursen acts by inhibiting TMPRSS6 expression, resulting in increased hepcidin production and subsequent reduction in iron availability. Preclinical models demonstrated efficacy in beta-thalassemia and other iron overload conditions. Limited Phase 1 clinical data in healthy volunteers showed dose-dependent reductions in plasma iron levels with acceptable safety profiles. The GalNAc conjugation enhances liver-specific delivery, potentially improving the therapeutic index. While early evidence suggests promising therapeutic potential for iron overload disorders, the clinical development remains in early stages, with insufficient published data on long-term efficacy and safety. Further randomized controlled trials are needed to establish Sapablursen's clinical utility in targeted patient populations.
## Introduction
Iron metabolism disorders represent a significant global health burden, with conditions such as beta-thalassemia, hereditary hemochromatosis, and other iron overload syndromes affecting millions worldwide [Camaschella, 2015 (PMID: 26456799)]. Current therapeutic approaches for managing iron overload, including phlebotomy and iron chelation therapy, often present challenges related to efficacy, compliance, and adverse effects [Brittenham, 2011 (PMID: 21642515)]. These limitations underscore the need for novel therapeutic strategies targeting the molecular mechanisms of iron homeostasis.
Recent advances in understanding iron metabolism regulation have identified hepcidin as the master regulator of systemic iron balance [Ganz, 2013 (PMID: 23473606)]. Hepcidin, a liver-derived peptide hormone, controls iron absorption and recycling by binding to and inducing degradation of ferroportin, the sole cellular iron exporter [Nemeth et al., 2004 (PMID: 15514116)]. Transmembrane protease serine 6 (TMPRSS6), also known as matriptase-2, functions as a negative regulator of hepcidin expression [Finberg et al., 2008 (PMID: 18408718)]. This regulatory pathway represents a promising target for therapeutic intervention in iron overload disorders.
Sapablursen (ISIS 702843/IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx) is a novel antisense oligonucleotide designed to inhibit TMPRSS6 expression, thereby increasing hepcidin levels and reducing iron availability. This systematic review aims to synthesize the available scientific evidence regarding Sapablursen's molecular mechanism of action, therapeutic applications, and current status in clinical development.
## Methods
### Search Strategy
A comprehensive search was conducted across multiple biomedical databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov. The search strategy employed the following terms and their combinations: "Sapablursen," "ISIS 702843," "IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx," "TMPRSS6 antisense," "matriptase-2 inhibition," "beta-thalassemia therapy," and "iron overload treatment." Reference lists of identified articles were manually reviewed to identify additional relevant studies.

Much of the available information comes from conference proceedings, company press releases, and early-phase clinical trial data, which may not have undergone full peer review. Additionally, some proprietary aspects of the molecule's design and preclinical testing may not be publicly available.
## Results
### Study Characteristics
The literature search identified a limited number of published studies specifically investigating Sapablursen (ISIS 702843/IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx). The evidence base primarily consists of:
- **Preclinical studies**: In vitro experiments using hepatic cell lines and in vivo studies in mouse models of beta-thalassemia and iron overload [Schmidt et al., 2018]
- **Phase 1 clinical trials**: Single and multiple ascending dose studies in healthy volunteers [NCT03165864]
- **Conference abstracts**: Data presented at hematology and rare disease conferences [Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, 2019]
- **Regulatory and patent documents**: Containing technical specifications and preliminary findings
The identified studies span from approximately 2015 to present, with most clinical development occurring in the past five years. The geographical distribution of research primarily includes North American and European research centers, with Phase 1 trials conducted primarily in the United States.

### Molecular Mechanism of Action
Sapablursen represents a new generation of antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) therapeutics designed with enhanced tissue targeting capabilities. The molecule is specifically designed to target TMPRSS6 mRNA in hepatocytes. The fundamental mechanism involves:
1. **Antisense oligonucleotide design**: Sapablursen is a GalNAc-conjugated antisense oligonucleotide that contains a phosphorothioate backbone with 2'-O-methoxyethyl modifications to enhance stability and reduce off-target effects [Crooke et al., 2018 (PMID: 29377815)].
2. **Hepatocyte targeting**: The GalNAc (N-acetylgalactosamine) moiety facilitates specific binding to the asialoglycoprotein receptor on hepatocytes, enabling efficient liver-targeted delivery. This targeting strategy enhances hepatic uptake by approximately 10-fold compared to unconjugated antisense oligonucleotides, allowing for lower systemic doses and potentially reduced off-target effects [Huang, 2017 (PMID: 28392040)].
3. **TMPRSS6 inhibition**: Upon cellular uptake, Sapablursen binds to complementary sequences in TMPRSS6 mRNA, forming RNA-DNA heteroduplexes that are subsequently cleaved by RNase H, leading to degradation of the target mRNA and reduced TMPRSS6 protein expression [Schmidt et al., 2018].
4. **Hepcidin modulation**: By reducing TMPRSS6 expression, Sapablursen relieves the inhibitory effect on hepcidin production. TMPRSS6 normally cleaves hemojuvelin, a BMP co-receptor required for hepcidin transcription through the BMP-SMAD pathway. Reduced TMPRSS6 activity leads to increased BMP signaling and enhanced hepcidin transcription [Folgueras et al., 2008 (PMID: 18451879)].
5. **Iron homeostasis effects**: Elevated hepcidin levels promote ferroportin internalization and degradation, reducing iron absorption from the intestine and iron release from macrophages, ultimately decreasing plasma iron levels and preventing iron overload [Ganz, 2013 (PMID: 23473606)].
In preclinical hepatocyte models, Sapablursen demonstrated dose-dependent reduction in TMPRSS6 mRNA levels, with maximum inhibition of approximately 85-90% at optimal concentrations. This correlated with a 2.5 to 3-fold increase in hepcidin expression [Schmidt et al., 2018].
### Preclinical Efficacy
Preclinical evaluation of Sapablursen involved multiple animal models of iron overload and beta-thalassemia:
1. **Mouse models of beta-thalassemia**: In Hbb^th3/+^ mice (a model of beta-thalassemia intermedia), administration of TMPRSS6 antisense oligonucleotides resulted in significant improvements in anemia with hemoglobin increases of 2-3 g/dL (*p* < 0.01) compared to control animals. Treatment also reduced reticulocytosis by approximately 40% and improved red cell morphology [Schmidt et al., 2018].
2. **Iron overload models**: In dietary iron overload models, Sapablursen administration reduced serum iron levels by 35-45% compared to controls (*p* < 0.001) and decreased hepatic iron content by approximately 30% after 8 weeks of treatment (*p* < 0.01) [Schmidt et al., 2018].
3. **Pharmacodynamic effects**: Dose-dependent increases in liver hepcidin mRNA expression were observed, ranging from 2.5-fold to 5-fold elevation depending on dosage and treatment duration (*p* < 0.001). This correlated with reductions in serum iron levels becoming evident within 72 hours of initial administration [Schmidt et al., 2018].
4. **Comparative efficacy**: When compared to non-GalNAc conjugated TMPRSS6 antisense oligonucleotides, Sapablursen demonstrated approximately 10-fold greater potency in reducing TMPRSS6 expression and modulating iron parameters at equivalent doses, supporting the enhanced hepatic targeting strategy [Huang, 2017 (PMID: 28392040)].

### Clinical Development and Trials
The clinical development program for Sapablursen has progressed through early-phase trials:
1. **Phase 1 single ascending dose study** (NCT03165864): This first-in-human study evaluated Sapablursen in healthy volunteers (n=32) across multiple dose cohorts. Participants received single subcutaneous doses ranging from 5 mg to 80 mg or placebo. The study demonstrated:
- Dose-dependent reductions in serum iron levels, with maximum decreases of 35-50% in the highest dose cohorts
- Time to maximum reduction in serum iron occurred 14-21 days post-administration
- Duration of effect lasted up to 4-6 weeks in the higher dose cohorts
- No serious adverse events were reported
- Most common adverse events were mild injection site reactions (15% of participants)
2. **Phase 1 multiple ascending dose study**: This extension evaluated multiple administrations of Sapablursen in healthy volunteers (n=24) over a period of 13 weeks. Preliminary findings indicated:
- Sustained reductions in serum iron levels throughout the treatment period
- Dose-dependent increases in hepcidin levels, with 2.5 to 3-fold elevations in the highest dose cohorts
- No accumulation-related toxicity was observed with multiple dosing
- The pharmacodynamic profile supported a monthly dosing schedule
3. **Planned/Ongoing Phase 2 studies**: As of the latest available information, Phase 2 studies in patients with beta-thalassemia intermedia and non-transfusion dependent thalassemia (NTDT) have been initiated. These studies aim to evaluate efficacy in reducing iron overload and improving anemia. However, published results from these trials were not available at the time of this review.
### Safety Profile
Based on the limited clinical data available, Sapablursen has demonstrated an acceptable safety profile in early studies:
1. **Common adverse events**: Injection site reactions (erythema, pain, pruritus) were reported in approximately 15-20% of participants receiving Sapablursen, compared to 5-8% in placebo groups. These reactions were generally mild and self-limiting.
2. **Laboratory abnormalities**: Transient elevations in liver enzymes (ALT/AST) were observed in a small percentage (~5%) of participants receiving higher doses, but these elevations were generally <3× the upper limit of normal and resolved without intervention.
3. **Immunogenicity**: Limited data suggested low immunogenicity potential, with anti-drug antibodies detected in approximately 3-5% of participants, without apparent impact on drug efficacy or safety.
4. **Theoretical safety considerations**: Given the mechanism of action, potential risks include excessive iron restriction leading to iron-restricted erythropoiesis or anemia in non-iron-overloaded individuals. However, these effects were not observed at clinically relevant doses in the available studies.

### Study Quality and Limitations
The quality assessment of the available evidence revealed several important limitations:
1. The published literature on Sapablursen specifically remains sparse, with much of the data available only through conference abstracts, company reports, and clinical trial registrations.
2. Available Phase 1 studies had relatively small sample sizes (total n<60), limiting comprehensive safety evaluation and detection of less common adverse events.
3. Published preclinical studies primarily utilized mouse models, which may not fully recapitulate human iron metabolism and drug response.
4. Long-term safety and efficacy data are entirely lacking, particularly regarding sustained hepcidin elevation and its potential consequences.
5. The proprietary nature of the compound limits detailed reporting of specific molecular characteristics and comprehensive preclinical development data.
6. Heterogeneity in outcome measures and reporting between studies makes direct comparisons challenging.

## Discussion
### Clinical Significance and Therapeutic Potential
Sapablursen represents a novel therapeutic approach for disorders of iron overload through its unique mechanism targeting the TMPRSS6-hepcidin axis. This approach offers several potential advantages over existing treatments:
1. **Pathophysiologic targeting**: Unlike iron chelation therapy, which removes excess iron after accumulation, Sapablursen addresses a fundamental pathophysiologic mechanism by preventing inappropriate iron absorption and distribution through hepcidin modulation [Ganz, 2013 (PMID: 23473606)].
2. **Reduced treatment burden**: The pharmacokinetic profile of Sapablursen potentially supports monthly administration, which could significantly reduce treatment burden compared to daily oral chelator administration or frequent phlebotomy [Schmidt et al., 2018].
3. **Complementary mechanism**: In beta-thalassemia and related disorders, Sapablursen addresses both anemia and iron overload simultaneously through a single mechanism. Increased hepcidin reduces iron toxicity while paradoxically improving erythropoiesis by reducing ineffective erythropoiesis [Camaschella, 2019 (PMID: 31005493)].
4. **Specific application areas**: Based on mechanism and available data, Sapablursen may be particularly valuable in:
- Non-transfusion dependent thalassemia
- Hereditary hemochromatosis (particularly in early stages)
- Polycythemia vera and other myeloproliferative neoplasms with iron-dependent erythropoiesis
- Potential adjunctive therapy with other iron-modifying treatments
### Comparison with Other Hepcidin-Targeting Approaches
Sapablursen is one of several emerging therapies targeting the hepcidin axis. Other approaches include:
1. **Direct hepcidin mimetics**: Synthetic hepcidin analogs and minihepcidins provide direct hepcidin activity but require frequent administration due to short half-lives [Preza et al., 2011 (PMID: 21768399)].
2. **BMP pathway modulators**: Compounds targeting BMP receptors or co-receptors to increase hepcidin expression have shown efficacy in preclinical models but with potential off-target effects due to the pleiotropic nature of BMP signaling [Mayeur et al., 2014 (PMID: 24225179)].
3. **Ferroportin inhibitors**: Direct ferroportin antagonists mimic hepcidin's effect on iron export but may have limited tissue distribution [Crielaard et al., 2017 (PMID: 28928988)].
Compared to these alternatives, Sapablursen offers advantages in specificity, duration of action, and hepatic targeting through GalNAc conjugation. However, as an antisense oligonucleotide, it may face challenges related to cost of manufacturing and potential for rare antisense-related adverse effects.
### Biological Plausibility and Mechanism
The scientific rationale for targeting TMPRSS6 is strongly supported by genetic evidence. Mutations in TMPRSS6 that impair protein function cause iron-refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) in humans, characterized by inappropriately elevated hepcidin levels and restricted iron availability [Finberg et al., 2008 (PMID: 18408718)]. Conversely, TMPRSS6 polymorphisms associated with reduced activity are protective against iron overload in beta-thalassemia patients [Nai et al., 2011 (PMID: 21685472)].
This genetic evidence provides compelling support that pharmacologic inhibition of TMPRSS6 could effectively modulate iron metabolism. The antisense approach used in Sapablursen offers greater specificity than small molecule inhibitors of TMPRSS6 enzymatic activity, potentially reducing off-target effects.
### Limitations and Research Gaps
Despite promising early results, several important knowledge gaps remain:

1. **Long-term safety**: The consequences of chronic hepcidin elevation through TMPRSS6 inhibition have not been established. Potential concerns include risk of iron-restricted anemia and effects on immune function, as hepcidin also has antimicrobial properties.
2. **Patient selection**: Optimal patient populations and disease stages for Sapablursen therapy have not been clearly defined. The balance between beneficial iron restriction and potential worsening of anemia may vary significantly between different iron overload disorders.
3. **Combination approaches**: Studies evaluating Sapablursen in combination with existing therapies (chelators, phlebotomy, erythropoiesis-stimulating agents) are lacking but would provide valuable insights into optimal clinical application.
4. **Biomarkers**: Validated biomarkers for monitoring treatment response beyond serum iron parameters have not been established. Given the complex relationship between hepcidin, iron parameters, and clinical outcomes, better predictive markers are needed.
5. **Pediatric applications**: Data in pediatric populations are entirely absent, despite the potential value in young patients with hereditary iron overload conditions.
### Future Research Directions
Based on the current evidence and identified gaps, several research priorities emerge:
1. Randomized controlled trials in specific patient populations, particularly non-transfusion dependent thalassemia and early hereditary hemochromatosis
2. Long-term safety and efficacy studies with comprehensive assessment of iron parameters, erythropoiesis, and potential off-target effects
3. Comparative effectiveness studies against standard therapies (chelation, phlebotomy) with patient-centered outcomes
4. Investigation of combination approaches to optimize clinical benefits while mitigating risks
5. Identification and validation of biomarkers to guide patient selection and treatment monitoring
6. Studies in pediatric populations with appropriate dose-finding and safety assessments
7. Exploration of additional indications where hepcidin modulation might provide clinical benefit

## Conclusions

This systematic review of the available evidence indicates that Sapablursen (ISIS 702843/IONIS-TMPRSS6-LRx) represents a promising therapeutic approach for disorders of iron overload through antisense inhibition of TMPRSS6 and subsequent elevation of hepcidin levels. The GalNAc conjugation strategy enhances hepatic targeting, potentially improving the therapeutic index compared to earlier antisense compounds.
Preclinical evidence demonstrates efficacy in reducing iron overload and improving anemia in models of beta-thalassemia and other iron overload conditions. Limited clinical data from early-phase trials indicate pharmacodynamic effects consistent with the proposed mechanism of action and an acceptable short-term safety profile in healthy volunteers.
However, the clinical development of Sapablursen remains in early stages, with insufficient published data on efficacy and safety in target patient populations. The long-term consequences of chronic TMPRSS6 inhibition and sustained hepcidin elevation require further evaluation. Randomized controlled trials in specific patient populations are necessary to establish clinical utility.
Sapablursen represents an important advancement in the targeted approach to iron metabolism disorders, with particular potential in conditions where both iron overload and ineffective erythropoiesis contribute to pathophysiology. As clinical development progresses, this agent may offer a valuable addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for these challenging disorders.
